# Lab 00 - Setup your environment

> **NOTE:**
>
> You can do the labs on your own environment, but you have to be careful: when you are using an environment where you are not the admin, it could happen that you don't have enough rights to perform all actions. You could for instance run into a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policy which could block the usage of the custom connector you are going to build in Lab 01.

## Step 1: Create your own developer tenant

You can create your own developer tenant through the Microsoft 365 Developer Program. Go to the Microsoft 365 Developer Program website and make sure to register for a free 25-user tenant. When you are done creating the tenant, make sure to go to the next step.

1. Go to [developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
1. Click **Join now**.

## Step 2: Add a Power Platform Developer account to the account you have in the developer tenant

The Power Apps Developer Plan gives you a free development environment to build and test with Power Apps, Power Automate, and Microsoft Dataverse. In this workshop, the Power Apps Developer Plan enables you to create a custom connector in lab 1.

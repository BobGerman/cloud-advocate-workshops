# Lab 03 - Create your first Custom Connector

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) and select **Solutions** in the left navigation.
2. Select our **Mixed Reality Workshop** solution.

## Create the custom connector

Click on the **+ New** button and take a look at all the options that are in this menu. These are all the solution components that you can create in a solution. In this case, we want to hover the **Automation** menu item, and then select **Custom Connector**.

This will open the custom connector creation wizard. In this wizard, we will create the custom connector for the [Smithsonian 3D API](https://3d.si.edu/). This API is very well documented. You can find the documentation [here](https://3d-api.si.edu/api-docs/). The only action available in this API is file search. This is the only action we need for this workshop, so don't worry!

### 1. General

Back in the Power Automate custom connector wizard, let's name the connector `Smithsonian 3D`.

In this screen, we can also add a connector icon, color, and a description. We will skip that for now, but we do fill in the host field. As you can see, the file search action in the API is a GET request to `https://3d-api.si.edu/api/v1.0/content/file/search`. This means that we can add **3d-api.si.edu** in the host field.

Navigate to the security part of the wizard by clicking on the tab `2. Security` or by clicking on the **Security →** button on the bottom right.

### 2. Security

In our case, the security tab is not that interesting, but in various other cases, this will be the place where you define your authentication. For instance, when connecting to the Microsoft Graph API, you will have to use the `OAuth2.0` authentication type.

For now, we will leave this on the `No authentication` authentication type. Let's move on to the `3. Definition` tab.

### 3. Definition

The definition tab is where you can add:

- Actions
- Triggers
- Policy templates

In this lab, we will only add one action. This is the file search, which you already read about earlier in this lab.

#### Add a new operation

Select the **⨁ New action** button on the left and fill in the following fields:

- **Summary**: `File search`
- **Description**: `This action searches the Smithsonian 3D API and fetches content based on a query/filter.`
- **Operation ID**: `FileSearch`
- **Visibility**: `important`

> **NOTE**:
>
> Most of the fields have blue 'Learn more' links next to the title of the field. The links lead you to the docs, which explain where these fields are shown in the products and what the best practices are. Most of the fields link to [this docs page](https://aka.ms/CustomConnectorsOpenAPISummary).

In the request section, select the **+ Import from sample** button and fill in the following fields:

- **Verb**: `GET`
- **URL**: `https://3d-api.si.edu/api/v1.0/content/file/search?q={q}&file_type={file_type}&quality={quality}&model_type={model_type}&gltf_orientation_compliant=true&draco_compressed=true&start=0&rows=10`

The header field can be blank in this case. If you filled the fields, click on the **Import** button.

The following request should get generated:

![View of the imported sample as a request.](assets/custom-connector-request-view.png)

#### Query parameters

Next, we are going to improve the query parameters, so that they are more useful for the users of the custom connector.

> **NOTE**:
>
> Make sure to check out the [docs](https://3d-api.si.edu/api-docs/) of the API. Most APIs already documented a lot of information that you can reuse. For instance: the Smithsonian 3D API has all the parameters documented. You can easily get all the information from there.

#### Responses

Responses are very important in the context of the Power Platform. Without responses, you will not be able to do anything with the data you are getting from the APIs you are sending requests to. The users of your connectors will be very thankful when you define all the responses, because that will make the connector easier to use.

If you look at the [API docs](https://3d-api.si.edu/api-docs/), you will see that the API creators added sample responses for both success and error responses. With this information, we can create our responses.

![A view of the success and error responses of the Smithsonian 3D API](assets/custom-connector-responses.png)

Take a look at the 'Response' section. You will see one response available there by default. It's called 'default'. Click on the 'default' button with the grey background.

This will open the 'Response' overview, which will give you the possibility to name your response and import a sample response, just like we did with the query parameters.

##### 200

The first step we need to do in the 'Response' overview is change the name from `default` to `200`. Next, we need to import the successful response sample. Select the **+ Import from sample** button and paste the following JSON in the body field.

```json
{
  "rows": [
    {
      "title": "Page induction coil from US Patent #76,654",
      "content": {
        "usage": "Web3D",
        "quality": "Medium",
        "uri": "https://3d-api.si.edu/content/document/3d_package:40cf5b52-0b21-4063-95fc-aa07998eb4dd/page-induction-coil-20k-512-medium.glb",
        "file_type": "glb",
        "draco_compressed": "true"
      }
    }
  ],
  "rowCount": 1,
  "message": "content found"
}
```

Select the **Import** button when you have done that. Just like with the request sample, the properties will be visible.

![View of the imported sample as a response.](assets/custom-connector-response-view.png)

In the screenshot above, you can see all the properties that are available in the body payload. These properties are available because they were in our sample JSON which we used to generate the response.

###### Message

Select the **˅** next to the 'message' in the body section which is visible in the screenshot above and select the **✏️ Edit** button.

In this screen, you will be able to change the properties of the 'message' schema property:

That will lead you back to the main screen with the definition. Now we have done a bunch of work, let's create the connector. Select the **✓ Create connector** button at the top right side of the screen. This will take a couple of seconds and it should give you a message at the top that Power Automate is saving your connector, and when it's done, it will show a message that it succeeded.

##### 400

Now we have defined our 'happy path', we also need to define responses for the error paths. Let's select the **+ Add default response** button in the 'Response' section to create a new response. Enter the following JSON sample into the 'Body' field and select the **Import** button.

```json
{
  "status": 400,

Timestamp was the latest property we had to modify. In the response overview screen, select the **← Back** button again and select the **✓ Update connector** button to update the connector with the latest changes. When the updating is done, select the tab `4. Code (Preview)`.

### 4. Code (Preview)

In this lab, we will not use this feature, but if you want to know more about the code feature: check out the [docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/custom-connectors/write-code). Select the tab `5. Test`.

### 5. Test

Testing a connector is very important. In this view you are able to perform technical tests. Every connector needs a connection, so that's what we will create first. Select the **+ New Connection** button in the Connections section. This will create a connection for you.

After creating the connection, you can try out the action you just created.

#### Example

In the below example we will use 'Mammuthus' as our query.

##### Request

![Example of the file search test, with 'Mammuthus' at the top as a query and a blue 'Test operation' button at the bottom](assets/custom-connector-test-file-search-request.png)

##### Response

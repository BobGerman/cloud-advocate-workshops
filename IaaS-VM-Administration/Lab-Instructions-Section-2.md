# Optimizing Virtual Machine Workloads on Azure.

## Section Two: Manage IaaS VM Configuration

Section two only requires that you have performed section zero and the parts of exercise 1.3 where you added an extra disk to SYD-WS2022.

### Exercise 2.1. Enable Boot Diagnostics

In this exercise, you will enable boot diagnostics on Azure IaaS Virtual Machines.

7.  With the Custom Profile set to **AutomanageLab**, choose **Enable**.

### Exercise 2.4. Configure Azure Policy for IaaS VM

In this exercise you will use Azure Policy to evaluate several elements of the configuration of IaaS VMs. Policy can be a useful tool to allow you to determine if your IaaS VMs are configured correctly or require manual or automatic remediation.

You can see a quick audio free video showing the lab steps here: [Exercise 2.4 Demo Video](https://youtu.be/1HG6jmKDoE4)

3. On the SYD-LINUX page, select **Policies** under **Operations**.
4. On the SYD-LINUX Policies page, choose **Assign Policy**.
5. On the **Assign Policy** page, select the ellipsis (â€¦) next to **Policy definition**.
6. On the list of Available Definitions, type **SSH** in the Search textbox and select the **Authentication to Linux machines should require SSH keys** checkbox and choose Add.
7. On the **Assign Policy** page, choose **Review and Create** and then choose **Create**.
8. In the **Search bar of the Azure Portal**, type **Virtual Machines** and then choose **Virtual Machines**.
9. In the list of virtual machines, select **SYD-WS2022**.
10. On the SYD-WS2022 Policies page, search for Policies and choose **Assign Policy**.
11. On the **Assign Policy** page, select tie ellipsis (â€¦) next to **Policy definition**.

16. In the list of virtual machines, select **SYD-LINUX**. On the SYD-LINUX Policies page, choose Refresh until the Compliance State changes to **Non-compliant**. This is because SYD-LINUX allows sign in via username and password to simplify the operation of this lab exercise. You can come back to this step later after you have completed exercise 2.6 if you donâ€™t want to wait for the compliance state to change.
17. In the **Search bar of the Azure Portal**, type **Virtual Machines** and then choose **Virtual Machines**.
18. In the list of virtual machines, select **SYD-WS2022**. On the SYD-WS2022 Policies page, choose Refresh until the Compliance State of the Certificates using RSA policy changes to Compliant. This may take several minutes. Note that the Authentication to Linux Machines policy will be listed as Compliant because SYD-WS2022 is not running the Linux operating system. You can come back to this step later after you have completed exercise 2.6 if you donâ€™t want to wait for the compliance state to change.

### Exercise 2.5. Connect via Serial Connection to IaaS VM

The serial console connection allows you to make a special administrative connection to an IaaS VM when there may be some sort of fault with the network configuration. Serial Console allows you to perform actions against the VM from a command line environment even if the network connection doesnâ€™t work. You can use this for troubleshooting or diagnosis purposes. You can make serial console connections to Linux IaaS VMs and Windows Server IaaS VMs.
